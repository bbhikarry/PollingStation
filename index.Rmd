.pull-right[From pollution to overfishing to climate change, two-thirds of the global ocean is negatively impacted by human activities. To recover and benefit from the broad range of ecosystem services the ocean provides we need to move to ecosystem-based management of marine ecosystems that are integrated, cross-sectoral and highly participatory.  

Project proposals must be implemented in developing countries but may be submitted by applicants from anywhere.<!-- All proposals should include a special focus on gender mainstreaming, livelihood creation, and poverty reduction.--> Concepts passing initial review and meeting OIC criteria will be invited to submit full proposals for further internal and external review and consideration. ]

## Blue Tourism quick reminder

A French Global Environment funded (FGEF) pilot project seeking to identify sustainable practice in the marine tourism sub-sector within the Mediterranean, Caribbean and West Indian Ocean. Its scheduled to run over 4 years beginning July 2022 with a budget of 4,325.900 euro.

#### Objectives (All countries)

1. Draw up an inventory of coastal tourism, to survey the changes desired by its actors and to identify possible synergies for a sustainable management of blue tourism

2. To orient local tourism development strategies towards sustainable blue tourism in pilot sites

3. To support the implementation of action plans and fund pilot projects in pilot sites

4. To monitor, evaluate and capitalise on the local implementation of exemplary blue tourism projects initiated by civil society actors

5. To integrate sustainable tourism on a regional scale, to share feedback and to raise awareness among stakeholders

## Components
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Component 1]
*Short name: Diagnosis*  

Assess the economic, environmental and social impacts of the Covid crisis on tourism at different scales and identify levers for a sustainable recovery

The tourism sector is deeply affected by the current health crisis, particularly in economic and social terms. The aim is to establish a diagnosis of some of these impacts on a global scale and in the three regions targeted, and to identify levers for a sustainable recovery of the sector. A methodological approach and a set of best practices for implementing sustainable blue tourism management will conclude these diagnoses. <!--Then, a specific diagnosis will be conducted at each identified pilot sites, including a specific adaptation of the blue tourism implementation methodology.-->

]
.panel[.panel-name[Component 2]
*Short name: Pilot projects*
 
Encourage the development of sustainable blue tourism at the pilot site level through the planning and implementation of pilot projects. In each pilot site, new tourism planning strategems will be set up in conjunction with public, private and civil society concerns, resulting in a road map for each site. Help will be provided for the implementation of these road maps by advising, capacity building and granting of pilot projects. This granting will finance small pilot projects of pre-selected actors on the basis of transparent selection criteria.<!--  A mechanism of calls for proposal might be set up if relevant. -->
]

.panel[.panel-name[Component 3]
*Short name: Awareness, Communication and Feedback*

Integrate sustainable tourism into the agenda of marine regions, promote the sharing of experiences and include sustainable tourism issues in the public debate


This component aims to include sustainable tourism in the agenda of the Barcelona (Mediterranean), [Cartagena (Caribbean)](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27875/SPAWSTAC5_2012-en.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y) and Nairobi (Western Indian Ocean) conventions to enable their States Parties and regular partners (NGOs, researchers, etc.) to draw up the outlines of possible regional collaborations and strategies. Component 3 is also dedicated to Communication and Dissemination of project results to key players in global, regional and national tourism.

Some thoughts.

For the last 15 years the global community - especially the UN, has been lobbying, prepping for global climate finance and the whole expected slew of expenses that come with Climate Change. We need to treat this pool of money as a resource to qualify for. Barbados has. The Lewards, Latin America even the Pan African states have.

Fixes should be aligned with the SDGs - as the UN has expended great effort to give the Goals more international recognition than our homespun brand 'Beyond ...' can. The SDGs should be marketed appropriately. 
 
Position will come almost automatically as a result of partnerships with the various sectors local regional and international.
